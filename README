To Install
----------

Install Python with SQLITE (http://python.org)

Download cedict_1_0_ts_utf-8_mdbg.txt from:

http://www.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php?page=cc-cedict

Put it in the same folder as these files.

If you aren't running a Posix shell maybe you need to change
the encodings...

From the folder with the files in, run python make_db.py

To Use
------

Open a command prompt and go to the right folder

The lookup.py script does its best to translate a word or standard phrase
from either English or Chinese.  Examples:

python lookup.py to question closely
叮问 [ding1 wen4] to question closely/to make a detailed inquiry/to probe/to ask repeatedly
追问 [zhui1 wen4] to question closely/to investigate in detail/to examine minutely/to get to the heart of the matter
追询 [zhui1 xun2] to interrogate/to question closely

python lookup.py 叮问
叮问 [ding1 wen4] to question closely/to make a detailed inquiry/to probe/to ask repeatedly

python lookup.py ding wen
叮问 [ding1 wen4] to question closely/to make a detailed inquiry/to probe/to ask repeatedly

The translate.py script looks up all words (as far is at can recognize them)
in a chinese text and gives English translations.  Example:

python translate.py 戈瑞安
戈 [ge1] spear/surname Ge
瑞安 [rui4 an1] (N) Rui'an (city in Zhejiang)

You can also give it a file name, and it looks up all the words in that file.
The file name must have only simple English characters, so that it isn't
recognized as chinese text.

The longest possible word is chosen at any given point.  That saves you
looking up a character only to discover it makes no sense on its own, and
was really the second character in a word.  This sometimes finds overlong
words.  For example:

translate 中国人民
中国人 [zhong1 guo2 ren2] Chinese person (中國人)
民 [min2] the people/nationality/citizen

should have given:

中国 [zhong1 guo2] China/Middle Kingdom (中國)
人民 [ren2 min2] the people/CL:個|个[ge4]
